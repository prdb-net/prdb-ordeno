# ADR 0013: the container starts as root and does not stay there. This works out
# which identity the user's files should belong to, hands the tool's own data
# directory over to it, and execs the application under it.
#
# exec, not a supervisor: the application ends up as PID 1, so `docker stop`
# reaches it and a move in progress is interrupted properly rather than the
# container being killed once the timeout runs out.
#
# bash rather than sh, although nothing below is a bashism: /bin/sh here is dash,
# and dash drops environment variables whose names are not valid shell
# identifiers instead of passing them on. Every .NET logging category has a dot
# in it — `Logging__LogLevel__Microsoft.AspNetCore`, `Logging__LogLevel__Prdb.Ordeno`
# — so under dash the one setting anybody is asked to change while diagnosing a
# problem never reaches the application, and nothing says so. `docker exec env`
# still shows it, because that is the container's configured environment rather
# than the process's; /proc/1/environ is where it is missing. smoke-test.sh
# checks that it arrives.
